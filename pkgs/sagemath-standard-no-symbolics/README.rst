SageMath fully supports all major Linux distributions, recent versions of macOS, and Windows (using Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The traditional and recommended way to install SageMath is from source via Sage-the-distribution (https://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html).  Sage-the-distribution first builds a large number of open source packages from source (unless it finds suitable versions installed in the system) and then installs the Sage Library (sagelib, implemented in Python and Cython).


About this experimental pip-installable source distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pip-installable source distribution `sagemath-standard-no-symbolics` is an experimental subset distribution of the Sage library.

Its main purpose is as a technical tool for the modularization project (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29705),  to test that large parts of the Sage library are independent of the symbolics subsystem.
