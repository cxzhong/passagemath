SageMath fully supports all major Linux distributions, recent versions of
macOS, and Windows (using Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The traditional and recommended way to install SageMath is from source via
Sage-the-distribution (https://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html).
Sage-the-distribution first builds a large number of open source packages from
source (unless it finds suitable versions installed in the system) and then
installs the Sage Library (sagelib, implemented in Python and Cython).
